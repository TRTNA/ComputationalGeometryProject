# ComputationalGeometryProject

Repository for the Computational Geometry project (master's degree course).

This project is a graphical application meant to be an educational tool. Its main purpose is to show how surfaces can be created through the use of polynomials (of 1st and 2nd degree).

The application has been developed using C++ and OpenGL 4.1. It has been be compiled using Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools and Windows SDK version 10.0.22000.0. It has been tested ONLY with the aformentioned SDK and build tools.

The Mesh and Camera class are based on the ones presented in https://github.com/JoeyDeVries/LearnOpenGL/blob/master/includes/learnopengl/
